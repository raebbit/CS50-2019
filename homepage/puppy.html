        <h4>When I first came home..</h4>
        <p><img src="/images/puppy1.jpg" alt="Cute puppy" style="width:200px;height:250px">
        <img src="/images/puppy3.jpg" alt="Selfie mode!" style="width:200px;height:250px"><br>
        It has been 4 years. I won't forget the first week I came to this home.<br>I was confused and everything was so big.
        I might look sad in this picture.<br>But don't worry. I didn't know what 'taking pictures' means. That's why I look scared. LOL</p>
        <img src="/images/puppy2.jpg" alt="confused" style="width:200px;height:250px">
        <img src="/images/puppy4.jpg" alt="Get to know my hooman" style="width:200px;height:250px"><br>
        <p>Awwww <br> I was so cute! Everytime I went outside, I heard "Awwww" sound. <br> I guess that means 'hello'? <br>
        Hooman language is really hard to understand. When I was young, I had no idea what they were saying. <br>
        After 4 years with them, I started to understand some words and hand motions. <br> Well, that doesn't mean that I do
        what they tell me to do. ;)</p>
        <h4>How tiny!</h4>
        <img src="/images/howtiny1.jpg" alt="I was so tiny" style="width:250px;height:280px">
        <img src="/images/howtiny2.jpg" alt="Look at my size" style="width:250px;height:280px"><br>
        <p>As you can see, I was really tiny. <br> My hoomans worried so much because they thought I was a teacup poodle.<br>
        They didn't want me to be a teacup poodle. <br> Teacup poodle is not real. They are just made to be tiny by bad hoomans.<br>
        So, please be aware of that before you adopt us.</p>
