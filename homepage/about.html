        <p>Look at me now! <br> I am a big girl! I am not tiny anymore. I am 4 years old!!<br> That's like thirty-something in hooman age.</p>

        <p>Poodles have legs of supermodel. Naturally, I have great legs. <br>
        They are not long <sub>(remember! I'm a toy poodle)</sub> but perfect! </p>

        <h3>I have protective coloration.</h3>

        <p>Can you find me? Oh, you can't? <br> That's because I have protective coloration!<br>
        You can't find me when everything is golden brown. <br> Sadly, this special gift doesn't work when it's spring, summer, or ... winter.
        <br> But still.... how cool is it? LOL</p>

        <h3>I am fierce!!</h3>
        <img src="/images/dog1.jpg" alt="I'm a wild thing!" style="width:400px;height:420px">
        <p>I am a wild thing! Be careful! <br> I look so cute and kind. <br> But inside my heart, there is a wolf. Really scary one.<br>
        I have a jaw of tiger and paws of bear!!! <br> Well, don't worry. I never use them. <br> But when I do, you don't wanna mess with me.</p>
